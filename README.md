## Regression

### Linear Regression
A supervised learning algorithm used to model relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The model predicts continuous values.
- Formula: `Y = b0 + b1*X1 + b2*X2 + ... + bn*Xn`
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### Logistic Regression
Used for binary classification problems, where the output is a probability between 0 and 1.
- Formula: `P(Y=1|X) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))`, where `z = b0 + b1*X1 + ... + bn*Xn`
- Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy

## Gradient Descent
An optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent. 

### Types:
- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses the entire dataset to compute gradients.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Uses one sample per iteration.
- **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: Uses a subset of the dataset for each iteration.

## Classification

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
A non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. It predicts the label of a sample based on the majority label of its k nearest neighbors.

### Decision Trees
A flowchart-like tree structure where each node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision, and each leaf represents an outcome. Used for both classification and regression tasks.

### Random Forests
An ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees during training and outputs the majority class (classification) or average prediction (regression).

## Unsupervised Learning

### K-means Clustering
An unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster and updates the cluster centroids.

## Model Evaluation

### Accuracy, Precision, and Recall
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified samples.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives out of predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positives out of actual positives.

### F1 Score
A measure that balances precision and recall. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:
- Formula: `F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)`

### Confusion Matrix
A matrix used to evaluate classification models by comparing actual and predicted classifications:
|            | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Actual Positive | True Positive (TP)  | False Negative (FN) |
| Actual Negative | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN)  |

## Feature Engineering

### Data Preprocessing
Before feeding data into a model, it's crucial to preprocess it, including:
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scaling features to a similar range.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputation or removal of missing values.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### Feature Selection
Selecting the most important features to improve model performance. Methods include:
- **Filter methods**: e.g., Pearson correlation.
- **Wrapper methods**: e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
- **Embedded methods**: e.g., Lasso regression.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Grid Search
An exhaustive search over a predefined hyperparameter space, evaluating all possible combinations of hyperparameters.

### Random Search
A search where hyperparameters are randomly selected within a given distribution. Itâ€™s often more efficient than grid search.

---

## Neural Networks

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
A network of connected layers (input, hidden, and output layers). Each node (neuron) applies an activation function on weighted inputs and produces an output.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
A specialized type of neural network for processing structured grid data like images. Key components include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
A neural network where connections form cycles, allowing for the processing of sequential data such as time series or text. A popular variation is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

### Libraries
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source framework for machine learning and deep learning.
- **PyTorch**: A deep learning library known for its dynamic computational graph.
- **Keras**: A high-level API for building neural networks, often used with TensorFlow.

## Reinforcement Learning

### Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
A framework for modeling decision-making where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of an agent. It includes states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards.

### Deep Reinforcement Learning
Combines neural networks with reinforcement learning. Common algorithms include:
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Uses a neural network to approximate the Q-value function.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A popular policy gradient method for continuous action spaces.

## Natural Language Processing

### Tokenization and Text Preprocessing
Involves breaking down text into tokens and preparing it for machine learning models through:
- Lowercasing
- Removing stop words and punctuation
- Lemmatization/stemming

### Transformers
A state-of-the-art architecture for NLP tasks. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between words in a sentence. Popular transformer-based models include BERT and GPT.

### How GPT Works
GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) is a type of transformer model trained to generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence. GPT-3, for instance, has billions of parameters and can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.
